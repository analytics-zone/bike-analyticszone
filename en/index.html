    <div class="section-header">
      <div class="section-badge">FAQ</div>
      <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-list">
      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>How does this cycling analytics app get my data?</h3>
        <p>BikeAnalytics syncs with Apple Health to import cycling workouts recorded by any compatible device or app. This includes bike computers, smart trainers, and manual entries. The app processes this data locally to calculate advanced cycling performance metrics.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>What is FTP and how do I test it?</h3>
        <p>FTP (Functional Threshold Power) is the maximum power you can sustain for approximately one hour. The app includes a 20-minute FTP test protocol: warm up thoroughly, then ride at maximum sustainable effort for 20 minutes. Your FTP is 95% of average power. Repeat every 6-8 weeks to track progress and update training zones.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Do I need a power meter to use BikeAnalytics?</h3>
        <p>Yes. BikeAnalytics requires power data from a power meter for accurate FTP, TSS, and training zone calculations. Compatible with all power meters that sync to Apple Health via bike computers or smart trainers.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>How is cycling TSS calculated?</h3>
        <p>Training Stress Score (TSS) for cycling is calculated using power data and your FTP. The formula considers both intensity (normalized power vs FTP) and duration to quantify workout stress. This enables accurate fitness tracking through CTL, fatigue monitoring via ATL, and form assessment with TSB.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>What's the difference between road and MTB analytics?</h3>
        <p>BikeAnalytics offers specialized analysis modes for road cycling and mountain biking. Road mode uses standard 30-second power smoothing, while MTB mode applies different algorithms to account for highly variable terrain and efforts typical in off-road riding. Each mode provides discipline-specific metrics.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Is my cycling data private?</h3>
        <p>Yes. BikeAnalytics processes all cycling data locally on your iPhone. There are no external servers, no cloud accounts, no data transfers. You control exports: generate JSON, CSV, HTML, or PDF files with your cycling performance metrics and share them however you want.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Can I export my cycling data to share with coaches?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. Export rides and performance metrics in multiple formats: JSON for developers, CSV for spreadsheets, HTML for web viewing, or PDF for printable reports. Share via email, messaging, or any file-sharing method you prefer.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>What's the difference between monthly and annual plans?</h3>
        <p>Both plans offer identical features: all cycling performance metrics, unlimited training zones, road & MTB modes, multiple exports, and free updates. The only difference is price: annual saves 18% (equivalent to €3.25/month vs €3.99/month).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-item">
        <h3>Can I cancel my subscription anytime?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Subscriptions are managed through the App Store, so you can cancel anytime from Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions. If you cancel, you'll maintain access until the end of your current billing period.</p>
